# Solscout trading bot

⚠️ Disclaimer: This project is a work in progress and not yet ready for live trading.

## About

An open-source trading bot for the Solana blockchain that helps users find new tokens and execute trades. It offers features similar to other popular Solana trading bots but is fully open-source, allowing anyone to verify, modify, and contribute. By hosting it yourself, you avoid fees and have full control over your trades without any restrictions.

## MVP

- Login/register page
- Create a wallet on new account register and tie it to user

- Landing page with new tokens with basic filtering, Pull data from raydium only in the beginning (add other platforms later)

- Single token page where we see graph, transactions, holders, etc.. and simple buy/sell functionality

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: NextJS/TypeScript
- Backend: NestJS/TypeScript

## Later stages

- Rewrite critical infrastructure in Rust
- Add other platforms such as orca, pumpfun, moonshot, etc..
- Advanced filtering
- Copy wallet trades
